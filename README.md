# Talspiegelrechner
Welcome to the "Talspiegel" repository!

This app is designed to help medical staff calculate the lowest concentration of a medication without the need to draw blood right before the next dose is administered. The app uses a simple formula to calculate the assumed valley mirror concentration of the medication based on its concentration and other variables, even if blood is drawn before the actual valley mirror concentration is reached.

This tool can be especially useful in situations where it is not practical to ask the patient to make an appointment for a blood draw like in ambulant patients.

Thank you for using the "Talspiegelrechner" and we hope it helps you in your work to provide the best possible care for your patients.
